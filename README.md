# Devtop
The DE for Vubuntu.
For Vubuntu, please see https://github.com/Vubunt-Developer/Vubuntu-Alpha.
Devtop is in its very First Stage, so its pretty much bare bones. Devtop comes with Vubuntu, so no need to do these tedious tasks to use it. Devtop is best suited for Vubuntu because it does not come with any installed software; Vubuntu comes with it. For now, the main features of Devtop is BSPWM, Lxqt-panel, and Kupfer. There are other tasks in the background, but these are the main ones. Since Devtop is made for Vubuntu, You cannot simply use apt-get or such to install it. It is not recommended to install Devtop on your own system, but you can if you want to. These steps can also be used as a way to recover Devtop on Vubuntu.
