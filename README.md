# Devtop
Devtop Allows Developers to have a straight-forward GUI and lets Developers Get things Done.

The DE for AgileOS.

For Agile, please see https://github.com/Vubunt-Developer/Vubuntu-Alpha.


Devtop lets users glide through what they need to do, without clutter and easy access to apps.

In Agile Alpha 1.3.3 there are new Visuals to make it easier to use Devtop.

# How to access apps in Devtop

To run Devtop, Please try Agile, in the link posted above.

While logged in Devtop, press ``Ctrl+Alt+Space`` to start gnome-pie.

You can also use Kupfer, which lets you search with the keyboard. For that, just use ``Ctrl+Space``.

# How to Quit applications in Devtop

Some apps in Devtop will have a traditional Close, Maximize, and Minimize button in the top-right corner. Other apps do not feature this.

To quit these apps, Go to the top-left corner and click *File*. Then, Go to the bottom of the menu that appears and click quit.

If you do not see anything in the top left corner, you can either press ```Ctrl+W```, or press ```Alt``` and Use the *File* menu from there.

# How to customize Devtop

You can easily change the wallpaper by Right-clicking the desktop. Then just select *Change Wallpaper*.

Devtop uses Komorebi, LXQT-panel, kupfer, and gnome-pie for some main feautures. Maybe search some tutorials to customize?

Devtop also uses light-dm. To change the settings of Devtop, go to light-dm settings. You will need sudo permissions though, so make sure you have those.

# By the Way

Devtop is not like other Linux Desktops. You cannot just install it on any Debian-based distribution; You must Install on AgileOS.

This is because Devtop does not come with any Software, and does not have its own repository you can download from.

What you can do though, is Install the required software for Devtop on another Distro and copy and paste bash scripts used to run Devtop to another Distro.

This is not recommended, but if you really want to, you can.
